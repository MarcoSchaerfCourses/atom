# Atom Simulator

The goal of this project is to create an atom simulator, where the user can see and interact with any element of the periodic table, with its correct number of protons, neutrons and electrons. Also, for any element chosen, it also presents its relevant information, as shown below. The idea is to develop a fun and easy platform that can be used by students while learning chemistry, once that what are usually shown during classes are very poor 2D drawings.

This project was developed using three.js, which is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser and uses WebGL.

The source code of this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ibiscp/Atom-Simulator) and it can be tested in [this link](https://ibiscp.000webhostapp.com/atom.html).
